    <h2>KENSINGTON CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>

    <p>Instead of the Sub-Kensington Gardens Railway scheme as
    proposed, why not a Sub-Serpentine Line? Start it from the
    South Kensington Station, District-cum-Metropolitan system, run
    it with one station well-underground in the middle of
    Exhibition Road, whence an easy ascent to the Imperial
    Exhibition, when passengers would come up to "carp the vital
    airs," then right away again, branching off left and right,
    thus bringing the mild Southerners into rapid, easy
    communication, at all reasonable hours, and at reasonable
    prices, with the rugged denizens of the Northern districts,
    East and West. If Kensington Gardens are to be touched at
    all&mdash;and, not being sacred groves, there is no reason why
    they should not be, <i>faute de mieux</i>&mdash;a transverse
    tunnelling from Kensington High Street to Queen's Road would do
    the trick. We will be happy to render any assistance in our
    power, and are,&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

    <p class="author">WILL HONEYCOMB, MOLE, FERRET &amp; CO.,</p>

    <p class="author">(<i>Burrow-Knights</i>.)</p>

    <h4>II.</h4>

    <p>O sir,&mdash;Pleese don't let us ave no nasty railwaies and
    tunels in Kinsinton Gardins, were we now are so skludid, and
    the childern can play about, an no danger from nothink sep
    dogs, wich is mosley musseled, or led with a string, an we
    ain't trubbled about them, an can ave a word to say to a frend,
    or a cuzzin, you unnerstan, unner the treeses, so nice an
    quite, wich it wold not be wen disterbd by ingins, an smoke,
    skreeges, an steem-wizzels. O, <i>Mr. P.</i>, don't let um do
    it.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours obeegentlee, SARA JANE, (<i>Unner
    Nursrymade</i>.)</p>

    <h4>III.</h4>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;The Railway underneath Kensington Gardens won't
    be noticed if only taken down deep enough below the surface. No
    blow-holes, of course. No disfigurement. Take it under the
    centre path, <i>where there are no trees</i>, then turn to the
    left outside the gate and burrow away to S. Kensington Station.
    I can then get across the park in three minutes for a penny;
    and now I have to walk, for which I haven't the time, or take a
    cab, for which I haven't the money.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours, A PRACTICAL PAUPER.</p>

    <h4>IV.</h4>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;I take this opportunity of pointing out that if
    anything at all is to be done with Kensington Gardens, <i>why
    not make a real good Rotten Row there?</i> That would he a
    blessing and a convenience. We're all so sick and tired of that
    squirrel-in-a-cage ride, round and round Hyde Park, and that
    half-and-half affair in St. James's Park. No, Sir; now's the
    time, and now's the hour. There's plenty of space for all
    equestrian wants, without interfering with the sylvan delights
    of nurserymaids, children, lovers of nature, and all sorts of
    lovers too. For my part, if this is not put forward as an
    alternative scheme, I shall vote for tunnelling under the
    Gardens out of simple cussedness. If the reply, authoritatively
    given, be that the two schemes can go and must go together,
    then I will vote for both, only let's have the equestrian
    arrangement first.</p>

    <h2>THE TRIUMPH OF BLACK AND WHITE.</h2>

    <p>"After all, the best of KEENE's life-work is to be found in
    the innumerable cuts which he contributed to <i>Punch</i>
    during a period of nearly forty years; and still more in the
    originals of these, the masterly pen-and-ink drawings which are
    now for the first time shown in a collected form to the
    Public."</p>

    <p>So says Mr. CLAUDE PHILLIPS, in his "Prefatory Note," to the
    "Catalogue of a Collection of Drawings of the late CHARLES
    KEENE," now on view at the Rooms of the Fine Arts Society, 148,
    New Bond Street.</p>

    <p>If the British Public possess that "taste for Art" and that
    "sense of humour" which some claim for and others deny to it,
    it (the B.P.) will throng the comfortable and well-lighted
    Gallery in New Bond Street, where hang some hundreds of
    specimens of the later work of the most unaffected humorist,
    and most masterly "Black-and-White" artist of his time. Walk
    up, Ladies and Gentlemen, and see&mdash;such miracles of
    delineation, such witcheries of effect, as were never before
    put on paper by simple pen-and-ink!</p>

    <p>It is difficult to realise sometimes that it <i>is</i> pen
    and ink, and that only&mdash;all the delightful display of
    fresh English landscape and unsophisticated British humanity,
    teeming with effects of distance, hints of atmosphere, and
    suggestions of colour. Many a much-belauded brush is but a
    fumbling and ineffective tool, compared with the ink-charged
    crowquill handled by CHARLES KEENE. Look at
    "<i>Grandiloquence</i>!" (No. 220) There's composition! There's
    effect! Stretch of sea, schooner, PAT's petty craft,
    grandiloquent PAT himself, a nautical Colossus astride on his
    own cock-boat, with stable sea-legs firmly dispread, the swirl
    of the sea, the swish of the waves, the very whiff of the wind
    so vividly suggested!&mdash;and all in some few square inches
    of "Black-and-White!"</p>

    <p>Look, again, at the breadth of treatment, the power of
    humorous characterisation, the strong charm of
    <i>technique</i>, the colour, the action, the marvellous ease
    and accuracy of street perspective in No. 16 ("<i>The Penny
    Toy!</i>"). Action? Why, you can <i>see</i> the old lady jump,
    let alone the frog! Fix your eye on the frightened dame's foot,
    and you'll swear it jerks in time to the leap of the "horrid
    reptile."</p>

    <p>Or at that vivid bit of London "hoarding," and London low
    life, and London street-distance in "<i>'Andicapped!</i>" (No.
    25.) Good as is the "gaol-bird," is not the wonderfully real
    "hoarding" almost better?</p>

    <p>Who now can draw&mdash;or, for that matter,
    <i>paint</i>&mdash;such a shopkeeper, <i>such</i> a shop,
    <i>such</i> a child customer as those in "<i>All Alive!</i>"
    (No. 41), where the <i>Little Girl</i> a-tip-toe with a wedge
    of cheap "Cheddar" at the counter, comes down upon him of the
    apron with the crusher, "Oh, mother's sent back this piece o'
    cheese, 'cause father says if he wants any bait when he's goin'
    a fishin', he can dig 'em up in our garden!"</p>

    <p>Are <i>you</i> a fisherman, reader? Then will you feel your
    angling as well as your artistic heart warmed by No. 75
    ("<i>The Old Adam</i>") and No. 6 ("<i>Wet and Dry</i>"), the
    former especially! What water, what Scotch boys, <i>what</i> a
    "prencipled" (but piscatorial) "Meenister"! Don't <i>you</i>
    feel your elbow twitch? Don't <i>you</i> want to snatch the rod
    from SANDY McDOUGAL's hand, and land that "fush" yourself,
    Sawbath or no Sawbath?</p>

    <p>But, bless us, one wants to describe, and praise, and
    <i>purchase</i> them all! A KEENE drawing, almost <i>any</i>
    KEENE drawing, is "a thing of beauty and a joy for ever" to
    everyone who has an eye for admirable art and adorable
    drollery. And good as is the <i>fun</i> of these drawings, the
    graphic force, and breadth, and delicacy, and freshness, and
    buoyancy, and breeziness, and masterly ease, and miraculous
    open-airiness, and general delightfulness of them, are yet more
    marked and marvellous. Time would fail to tell a tithe of their
    merits. An essay might be penned on any one of them&mdash;but
    fate forbid it <i>should</i> be, unless a sort of artistic
    CHARLES LAMB could take the task in hand. Better far go again
    to New Bond Street and pass another happy hour or two with the
    ruddy rustics and 'cute cockneys, the Scotch elders and
    Anglican curates, the stodgy "Old Gents" and broad-backed,
    bunchy middle-class matrons, the paunchy port-swigging-buffers,
    and hungry but alert street-boys, the stertorous cabbies, and
    chatty 'bus-drivers, the "festive" diners-out and wary waiters,
    the Volunteers and <i>vauriens</i>, the Artists and 'Arries,
    the policemen and sportsmen, amidst the incomparable street
    scenes, and the equally inimitable lanes, coppices,
    turnip-fields and stubbles, green glades and snowbound country
    roads of wonderful, ever-delightful, and&mdash;for his comrades
    and the Public alike&mdash;all-too-soon-departed CHARLES
    KEENE!</p>

    <p>Nothing really worthy of his astonishing life-work, of even
    that part of it exhibited here, <i>could</i> be written within
    brief compass, even by the most appreciative, admiring, and
    art-loving of his sorrowing friends or colleagues. Let the
    British Public go to New Bond Street, and see for itself, in
    the very hand-work of this great artist, what he made manifest
    during so many years in the pages of <i>Punch</i>, namely, the
    supreme triumph of "Black-and-White" in the achievements of its
    greatest master.</p>

    March 13:&mdash;"During Holy Week this theatre will be closed,
    re-opening on Saturday, March 28, with <i>The Bells</i>, which
    will also be played on Easter Monday night." Could any
    arrangement be more thoroughly in harmony with general
    ecclesiastical practice? Any liturgical student knows that the
    bells are played once on Holy Saturday, and that they should be
    played on Easter Monday is a matter of course.</p>

    <h2>A DIARY OF DOVER.</h2>

    <p><i>March, 1891</i>.&mdash;Fearful storm in the Channel, when
    the <i>Victoria</i> is all but lost. Proposals in all the
    newspapers for the immediate commencement of an adequate
    harbour.</p>

    <p><i>April, 1892</i>.&mdash;Hurricane in the Channel, when
    seventeen ships are lost, and the Club Train Boat (without
    passengers) is carried, high and dry, as far as Amiens, by the
    force of the weather. Renewed suggestions for the immediate
    building of an adequate harbour.</p>

    <p><i>May, 1893</i>.&mdash;Cyclone in the Channel, in which the
    British Fleet disappears. The newspapers once more urge the
    immediate commencement of the proposed adequate harbour.</p>

    <p><i>June, 1894</i>.&mdash;Disaster in the Channel. Every
    single vessel swamped, owing to the terrific weather. Again the
    Press invites commencement of an adequate harbour.</p>

    <p><i>July, 1895</i>.&mdash;Members of both Houses of
    Parliament, invited to take part in a State function at Calais,

    adequate harbour at Dover.</p>

    <p><i>Madam Helseth</i>. Lord forgive you,
    Miss!&mdash;(<i>fetching cruet-stand, and placing it on
    table</i>)&mdash;but you're making fun of me!</p>

    <p><i>Rebecca</i> (<i>gravely</i>). No, indeed. Nobody makes
    fun at Rosmershölm. Mr. ROSMER would not understand it.
    (<i>Shutting window.</i>) Ah, here is Rector KROLL. (<i>Opening
    door</i>.) You will stay to supper, will you not, Rector, and I
    will tell them to give us some little extra dish.</p>

    <p><i>Kroll</i> (<i>hanging up his hat in the hall</i>). Many
    thanks. (<i>Wipes his boots.</i>) May I come in? (<i>Comes in,
    puts down his stick, sits down, and looks about him.</i>) And
    how do you and ROSMER get on together, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> Ever since your sister, BEATA, went mad and
    jumped into the mill-race, we have been as happy as two little
    birds together. (<i>After a pause, sitting down in
    arm-chair</i>.) So you don't really mind my living here all
    alone with ROSMER? We were afraid you might, perhaps.</p>

    <p><i>Kroll</i>. Why, how on earth&mdash;on the contrary, I
    shouldn't object at all if you&mdash;(<i>looks at her
    meaningly</i>)&mdash;h'm!</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>interrupting, gravely</i>). For shame,

        <p>[<i>Enter</i> ROSMER, <i>gently and softly.</i></p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i>. So, my dear old friend, you have come again,
    after a year's absence. (<i>Sits down.</i>) We almost thought
    that&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Kroll</i> (<i>nods</i>). So Miss WEST was
    saying&mdash;but you are quite mistaken. I merely thought I
    might remind you, if I came, of our poor BEATA's suicide, so I
    kept away. We Norwegians are not without our simple tact.</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i>. It was considerate&mdash;but unnecessary.
    REB&mdash;I <i>mean</i>, Miss WEST and I often allude to the
    incident, do we not?</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>strikes Tändstickor</i>). Oh, yes, indeed.
    (<i>Lighting lamp</i>.) Whenever we feel a little more cheerful
    than usual.</p>

    <p><i>Kroll</i>. You dear good people! (<i>Wanders up the
    room.</i>) I came because the Spirit of Revolt has crept into
    my School. A Secret Society has existed for weeks in the Lower
    Third! To-day it has come to my knowledge that a booby-trap was
    prepared for me by the hand of my own son, LAURITS, and I then
    discovered that a hair has been inserted in my cane by my
    daughter HILDA! The only way in which a right-minded
    Schoolmaster can combat this anarchic and subversive spirit is
    to start a newspaper, and I thought that you, as a weak,
    credulous, inexperienced and impressionable kind of man, were
    the very person to be the Editor.</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>with a look at Rosmer</i>). Tell him
    now!</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>returning the look</i>). I
    can't&mdash;some other evening. Well, perhaps&mdash; (<i>To</i>
    KROLL.) I can't be your Editor&mdash;because (<i>in a low
    voice</i>) I&mdash;I am on the side of LAURITS and HILDA!</p>

    <p><i>Kroll</i> (<i>looks from one to the other, gloomily</i>).
    H'm!</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i>. Yes. Since we last met, I have changed my
    views. I am going to create a new democracy, and awaken it to
    its true task of making all the people of this country
    noblemen, by freeing their wills, and purifying their
    minds!</p>

    <p><i>Kroll</i>. What <i>do</i> you mean? [<i>Takes up his
    hat.</i></p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>bowing his head</i>). I don't quite know,
    my dear friend; it was REB&mdash;I should say. Miss WEST's
    scheme.</p>

    <p><i>Kroll</i>. H'm! (<i>A suspicion appears in his face.</i>)
    Now I begin to believe that what BEATA said about
    schemes&mdash;no matter. But, under the circumstances, I will
    <i>not</i> stay to supper.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Takes up his stick, and walks out.</i></p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i>. I <i>told</i> you he would be annoyed, I
    shall go to bed now. I don't want any supper. [<i>He lights a
    candle, and goes out; presently his footsteps are heard
    overhead, as he undresses.</i> REBECCA <i>pulls a

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>to</i> Madam HELSETH, <i>who enters with
    dishes</i>). No, Mr. ROSMER will not have supper to-night.
    (<i>In a lighter tone.</i>) Perhaps he is afraid of the
    nightmare. There are so many sorts of White Horses in this
    world!</p>

    <p><i>Mad. H.</i> (<i>shaking</i>). Lord! lord! that Miss

    <p><i>Rosmer</i>. Yes, Miss WEST and I have worked our way
    forward in faithful comradeship.</p>

    <p><i>Kroll</i> (<i>shakes his head at him slowly</i>). So I
    perceive. Miss WEST is naturally inclined to be forward. But, I
    say, <i>really</i> you know&mdash; However, I came to tell you
    that poor BEATA was not so mad as she looked, though flowers
    <i>did</i> bewilder her so. (<i>Taking off his gloves
    meaningly.</i>) She jumped into the mill-race because she had
    an idea that you ought to marry Miss WEST!</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>jumps half up from his chair</i>). I?
    Marry&mdash;Miss WEST! my good gracious, KROLL! I don't
    <i>understand</i>, it is <i>most</i> incomprehensible.
    (<i>Looks fixedly before him</i>.) How <i>can</i> people&mdash;
    (<i>looks at him for a moment, then rises.</i>) Will you get
    out? (<i>Still quiet and self-restrained.</i>) But first tell
    me why you never mentioned this before?</p>

    <p><i>Kroll</i>. Why? Because I thought you were both orthodox,
    which made all the difference. Now I know that you side with
    LAURITS and HILDA, and mean to make the democracy into
    noblemen, and accordingly I intend to make it hot for you in my
    paper. <i>Good</i> morning! [<i>He slams the door with spite
    as</i> REBECCA <i>enters from bed-room.</i></p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>as if surprised</i>). You&mdash;in my
    bedroom! You have been listening, dear? But you <i>are</i> so
    emancipated. Ah, well! so our pure and beautiful friendship has
    been misinterpreted, bespattered! Just because you wear a
    morning wrapper, and have lived here alone for a year, people
    with coarse souls and ignoble eyes make unpleasant remarks! But
    what really <i>did</i> drive BEATA mad? <i>Why</i> did she jump
    into the mill-race? I'm sure we did everything we could to
    spare her! I made it the business of my life to keep her in
    ignorance of all our interests&mdash;<i>didn't</i> I, now?</p>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> You did&mdash;but why brood over it? What
    <i>does</i> it matter? Get on with your great, beautiful task,
    dear, (<i>approaching him cautiously from behind</i>), winning
    over minds and wills, and creating noblemen, you
    know&mdash;<i>joyful</i> noblemen!</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>walking about, restlessly, as if in
    thought</i>). Yes, I know. I have never laughed in the whole
    course of my life&mdash;we ROSMERS don't&mdash;and so I felt
    that spreading gladness and light, and making the democracy
    joyful, was properly my mission. But <i>now</i>&mdash;I feel
    too upset to go on, REBECCA, unless&mdash; (<i>Shakes his head
    heavily.</i>) Yes, an idea has just occurred to
    me&mdash;(<i>looks at her, and then runs his hands through his
    hair</i>)&mdash;oh, my goodness, no&mdash;I <i>can't</i>.</p>

    <blockquote>

    <p><i>Reb.</i> Be a free man to the full, ROSMER&mdash;tell me
    your idea.</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). I don't know what you'll
    say to it. It's this. Our platonic comradeship was all very
    well while I was peaceful and happy. Now that I'm bothered and
    badgered, I feel&mdash;<i>why</i>, I can't exactly explain, but
    I <i>do</i> feel that I must oppose a new and living reality to
    the gnawing memories of the past. I should, perhaps, explain
    that this is equivalent to an Ibsenian
    proposal.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"

    <p><i>Reb.</i> (<i>catches at the chairback with joy</i>). How?

    What are you saying? You mustn't. I can't <i>think</i> what you
    mean. Go away, do!</p>

    <p><i>Rosmer</i> (<i>softly</i>). Be the new and living

    <p><i>Reb.</i> Never! Do not&mdash;<i>do</i> not ask me

    <p>In not following the advice given in the headline to this
    article, clever Mr. PINERO has made a mistake. <i>Lady
    Bountiful</i> with only a very little HARE is a disappointment.
    The majority of those who go to "Hare's Theatre" (they don't
    speak of it as "The Garrick") go to see the Lessee and Manager
    in a new part: and they go to see a lot of him: they don't ask
    merely for a small piece of HARE, if you please, though they
    might be satisfied with HARE in a small piece. Everyone goes
    expecting to see him in a good part in a good Comedy, his good
    part being equal to the better part of the whole entertainment;
    and if they don't so see him, they are disappointed. Why was
    Mr. GRUNDY's happy translation of <i>Les Oiseaux</i> peculiarly
    successful? because it was a light, fresh, and pretty piece,
    wherein the occasional phrase in a minor key was so
    artistically introduced as to be a relish to our enjoyment of
    the humour of the characters and of the situations; but all
    this would have gone for comparatively little had it not been
    for the excellence of Mr. HARE's rendering of the first-rate
    part of <i>Goldfinch</i>, which did not consist of occasional
    flashes, only to collapse and disappear in the penultimate Act,
    but continued right through to the end, dominating everything
    and everybody. This is not so with <i>Lady Bountiful</i>. The
    appearance of <i>Roderick Heron</i>, who is no creation of the
    Author's, as he admits, but merely <i>Mr. Skimpole</i> under
    another name, raises hopes at the commencement, which are
    blighted long before the finish. The part gutters out, as does
    Mr. CHARLES GROVE's <i>John Veale</i>, another "promise of
    spring." Young Mr. GILBERT HARE makes a most creditable first
    appearance as <i>Sir Lucian Brent, Bart</i>. He is easy and
    natural.</p>

    <p>For the greater part of the educated audience, it might have
    been more useful if <i>Sir Richard Philliter, Q.C.</i>, had
    gone about with an old Eton Latin Grammar in his pocket,
    instead of a <i>Horace</i>; and if Miss KATE RORKE had divided
    with him the quotation, "<i>Nemo mortalium omnibus horis
    sapit.</i>" He, being rejected, might have commenced, "<i>Nemo
    mortalium</i>," and she might have continued, "<i>omnibus
    horis</i>;" then, both together, "<i>sapit</i>." Or when she
    had snubbed him, he might have made some telling remark about
    "<i>Verbum personale</i>," and so forth. The introduction of a
    quotation from <i>Horace</i> is likely rather to be resented
    than appreciated by the victims of a superior education. What a
    bad quarter of an hour or so Paterfamilias will have when
    Materfamilias asks him for the translation of these lines from
    <i>Horace</i>! Poor Pater will pretend not to have "quite
    caught them;" or "not been attending;" but to himself he will
    own how entirely he has forgotten his Latin, and perhaps he
    will make a good resolution to himself to "look up his
    <i>Horace</i> again." Then the learned young lady will be asked
    by her Mamma, or by her sharp young bothering sister, "what
    that Latin means," and though she might be able to construe it
    when she sees it, to translate it offhand at one hearing is a
    difficulty, and she will evade the question by saying, "Please,
    don't talk! I want to listen to the piece."</p>

    <p>The youth in the Stalls, fresh from college or school, will
    be about as much equal to the translation offhand as is young
    <i>Sir Lucian Brent</i> when asked by Mr. CATHCART to give the
    meaning of the Latin on the ancient brasses in the old church,
    and they won't thank you for bringing school studies into
    playtime. On the whole, nothing is gained by this Dr.
    Panglossian introduction of Latin quotation; it doesn't help
    the action, nor emphasise a character, nor does it strengthen a
    situation, to bring in even the most appropriate lines which
    are not "in a language understanded of the people." <i>Sir
    Richard Philliter, Q.C.</i>, might be known in private life to
    his friends as Sir HORACE DAVUS (<i>Non Oedipus</i>). Mr.
    CATHCART's <i>Pedgrift</i>, parish clerk and sexton, is an
    excellent little character-sketch, as is also that of <i>Mrs.
    Hornutt</i>, the pew-opener.</p>

    <p>As for Mr. FORBES ROBERTSON and Miss KATE RORKE, they seemed
    to me to be what the author had made them&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
    stagey. Miss DOLORES DRUMMOND, as <i>Mrs. Veale</i>, is very
    good, and Miss MARIE LINDEN, except in one stagey bit in the
    Third Act, plays with great care and judgment. The interior of
    the old country church (Act III.) is a masterpiece of scenic
    art and stage arrangement,&mdash;a perfect picture by Mr. W.
    HARFORD. I wish I could say the same of the <i>dénoûment</i> of
    the interrupted marriage, which strongly reminded me of a
    pictorial heading to some exciting chapter in a penny novelette
    or <i>The London Journal</i>. It is a very weak finish, and not
    strengthened or improved in any way by the line <i>Sir Richard
    Philliter, Q.C.</i>, has to say, on which the Curtain descends.
    And what does everybody exclaim afterwards? Simply, "Why
    there's nothing for HARE to do in it. We thought we should see
    him again, and that he would come out all right at last."
    That's the feeling. They can't bear the idea of their favourite
    first-class Comedian being a sordid, swindling old villain,
    unless the character be exceptionally amusing. <i>Lady
    Bountiful</i> might be termed "A bald piece," because it has so
    little HARE.</p>

    <h2>THE BOAT-RACE TEN YEARS HENCE!</h2>

    <h4>(<i>When no doubt it will be conducted on strictly
    scientific principles.</i>)</h4>

    <p>The crews were met together on the day fixed for the event
    in the Council Room of the Combined Universities Barge moored
    at Putney. Fifteen of the athletes wore the usual training
    <i>mufti</i>, which contrasted strongly with the garb of the
    sixteenth&mdash;a complete suit of flannels. "To quote our
    ancestors&mdash;'Why this thusness?'" asked the Camford Stroke,
    as he recognised one of his own men in this strange
    apparel.</p>

    <p>"Why not?" replied the other; "surely we are not going to
    pull in tweeds?"</p>

    <p>"We are not going to pull at all," explained the leader of
    the Oxbridge Eight, courteously; "I think we can manage the
    matter in a more satisfactory fashion. It was all very well in
    the Nineties to race in real earnest, but now that we have
    reached the Twentieth Century our civilisation teaches
    something better."</p>

    <p>"Certainly!" returned the Camford Stroke; "and I think we
    had better get at once to business. Who has the sworn
    information of our respective coaches?"</p>

    <p>"I have," replied the Hon. Solicitor to the rival Boating
    Clubs; "and, if you will allow me, I will produce them&mdash;or
    rather <i>it</i>, for the coaches have affirmed jointly."</p>

    <p>All present bowing acquiescence, the man of law, putting on
    his spectacles, and opening a brief-bag, produced a document,
    and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"It is our opinion that Oxbridge, as the heavier crew, has
    an advantage over Camford, which is only lessened, and
    certainly not entirely removed, by the better training of the
    latter. Moreover, the steering of the Oxbridge coxwain is
    infinitely preferable to the steering of his rival. The times
    of the various trials, too, have in every instance given a
    distinct advantage to Oxbridge. Again, they have a better boat.
    So, given fine weather, the result is a foregone conclusion.
    Oxbridge must win, although no doubt Camford would make a good
    fight for it, and come in a respectable second."</p>

    <p>"I suppose we may add, 'barring accidents'?" suggested the
    Camford Stroke, with rather a forced laugh.</p>

    <p>"Sir!" exclaimed the Hon. Solicitor, with some severity. "In
    a company of gentlemen like those present, accidents always
    <i>are</i> barred!"</p>

    <p>"Quite so," admitted the Camford champion, "and I suppose
    our committee of the latest Senior Wrangler and the youngest
    Double First have considered what I may call the atmospheric
    conditions under which the race would have taken place?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Sir, we have, and those conditions are all
    unfavourable to the success of Camford," was the ready
    reply.</p>

    <p>"Then I think we have but one more thing to do&mdash;to give
    three hearty cheers for our opponents." said the Oxbridge
    Stroke, and a minute later the rafters rang with loud
    applause.</p>

    <p>"But why shouldn't we have rowed it out?" asked the
    gentleman in flannels&mdash;he was a Freshman&mdash;a little
    later. "Surely that would have been more satisfactory."</p>

    <p>"Not at all," was the reply. "The plan is merely a survival
    of the fittest!" and his answer afforded general
    satisfaction.</p>

    <p>The Baron can highly recommend <i>The Wages of Sin</i>, by
    LUCAS MALET. "I am informed," says the B. DE B.-W., "that this
    is the <i>nom de plume</i> of an Authoress. This MALET should
    be Femalet." Be this as it may, the Baron, who is discretion
    itself, will not attempt to penetrate beyond the veil. Some of
    the writing is a bit tall; but thank heaven, my old æsthetic
    friend, "O-the-pity-of-it" occurs only once; and O the pity of
    it when he does so, and gives a "MAUDLE and POSTLETHWAITE" tone
    to the passage in question. What does "huffle" mean? (Vol.
    III., p. 82.) Genius has a right to create words; and when
    Genius does so, the very sound of the word conveys its meaning
    with and frequently without the context. "But I'm huffled,"
    says the Baron, "if I understand it here." Still "huffled" is a
    good-substitute for strong language, when you're ruffled. Don't
    let the light-hearted reader be deterred by the slow pace of
    Volume One; but stick to it, and avoid skipping. A selfish mean
    cuss is the "hero," so to style him; and personally, the Baron
    would consider him in Society as a first-class artistic bore.
    The character is drawn with great skill, as are they all. The
    description of <i>Mrs. Crookendon's</i> after-dinner party is
    as life-like as if it were a well-staged scene in a
    well-written and well-cast Drama.</p>

    <p>"I have been dipping into <i>Country House Sketches</i>, by
    C.C. RHYS," says the Baron, "and have come to the conclusion
    that if the author, youthful I fancy, would give himself time,
    and have the patience to 'follow my LEVER,' the result would be
    a <i>Jack Hinton Junior</i>, with a smack of <i>Soapey
    Sponge</i> in it." The short stories are all, more or less,
    good, and would be still better but for a certain cocksureness
    about them which savours of the man in a country house who will
    insist on telling you a series of good stories about himself,
    one after the other, until the guests in the smoking-room, in
    sheer despair of ever getting their turn of talking about
    themselves, or of turning on the tap of their own good stories,
    light their candles, yawn, and go pensively to bed.</p>

    <p>My "Faithful Co." informs me that he has been reading some
    very excellent <i>Sketches of England</i>, by a "Foreign
    Artist," and a "Foreign Author." The latter is no less a person
    than the genial representative of the <i>Journal des Débats</i>
    in London, Mons. P. VILLARS. My "Co." says that, take it all
    round, this is one of the best books upon <i>La Perfide
    Albion</i> he has ever read. Both scribe and illustrator are
    evidently fond of the "Foreigners" they find in the British
    Isles. Mons. VILLARS, however, makes one startling assertion,
    which has taken my "Co," by surprise. The "Foreign Author"
    declares that "laughter never struck his ears." Now our
    Monsieur is an admirable <i>raconteur</i>, and if he ever told
    one of his capital stories to an Englishman of average
    intelligence, he <i>must</i> have heard laughter. He has also
    read a rather strange work called, <i>What will Mrs. Grundy
    say?</i> My "Co." declares that, considering its subject, the
    book, which is not without merit, might be recommended as a
    disciplinary exercise during Lent.</p>

    <p>Says "Co. Junior," to the Baron, "Sir, I've just come across
    AUSTIN DOBSON and his <i>Four Frenchwomen</i>." "Hold!" cries
    the Baron, frowning. "No scandal." "Nay, Sir," quoth "Co.
    Junior," nervously. "'tis but the title of a book." "That is
    another thing," says the Baron, waving his hand, "proceed!" "It
    is about Mlle. DE CORDAY, Madame ROLAND, the Princesse DE
    LAMBALLE, and Madame DE GENLIS. I recommend it, Sir. <i>Tolle,
    Lege!</i> "And with a bow "Co. Junior," withdraws from the
    presence.</p>

    <p>Quoth the Baron, "I was looking again into <i>Saint
    Monica</i>, just to see if I might like it any better than I
    did on the first occasion&mdash;which, "with me hand upon me
    hearrt," as Doctor O'Q. says, I cannot say I do,&mdash;when I
    came upon the following misprint,&mdash;"<i>This woman,
    nevertheless, worshipped him as the god of her idoltary.</i>"
    It's a beautiful word, "idoltary," and so much better than the
    ordinary way of spelling it. So, after all, there is more in
    <i>Saint Monica</i> than I had expected. In fact, its chief
    fault is that it is too much spun out; and, just at this time,
    <i>Saint Monica</i> mustn't be associated in any sort of way
    with the House at Cambridge where they spin.</p>

    <p>In the <i>Times</i> for March 12th appeared a notice of The
    Spring Flower Show, wherein it was stated that a silver medal
    was awarded to Mr. BARR for his "<i>pretty collections, which
    included the spurius Henry Irving</i>." There's an "o" omitted,
    of course, but it's the same word. Who is the "spurious HENRY
    IRVING"? Where does this flower of the Drama flourish, away
    from the Lyceum Theatre? What and where does HENRICUS SPURIUS
    play? Does he appear in the Hare-Bells? Is he to bloom in
    Covent Garden? or is it, after all, only a plant? There is only
    one HENRICUS IRVINGUS, and he's not "<i>spurius</i>."</p>

    and apparent cessation of the heart's action. I am also so
    nervous, that, whenever the door is opened, I begin to scream
    loudly. My mental feebleness finds vent in puns that have
    alienated my oldest friends. Could some Correspondent explain
    these symptoms? I do not believe in Doctors, but am taking
    "Soft-sawder's Emulgent Balsam of Aconitine." It does not seem
    to have done me much good yet, but that is probably due to my
    not having tried it long enough.&mdash;RATHER ANXIOUS.</p>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>[HER MAJESTY in the evening witnessed the performance of
        <i>The Gondoliers</i>, a Comic Opera, composed by Sir
        ARTHUR SULLIVAN, in the Waterloo Chamber, by the Savoy
        Theatre Company, under the management of MR. R. D'OYLY
        CARTE.&mdash;<i>From the Times Court Circular, Monday,
        March 9.</i>]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>"A comic Opera, composed by Sir ARTHUR SULLIVAN." Quite so.
    But where does W.S. GILBERT come in? Let us see. After giving
    the programme, and after giving all the characters and the
    supers, the words "<i>Dramatis Personæ</i>" occur as an
    after-thought, and underneath are the names of the Musical
    Director, Stage Manager, Wig Provider, &amp;c., &amp;c. Well,
    "W.S.G." doesn't come in here. After the highly successful
    performance, R. D'OYLY CARTE, says the <i>Times</i> C.C., "had
    the honour of being presented to HER MAJESTY, who expressed her
    warm appreciation of the manner in which the performance was
    conducted." Did R. D'OYLY think of mentioning that "the words"
    were by W.S.G.? And then it is told how D'OYLY refused to take
    any payment for the performance. Noble, generous-hearted,
    large-minded, and liberal D'OYLY! Sir ARTHUR COURTLY SULLIVAN's
    name was to the Bill, and so his consent to this extra act of
    generosity may be taken for granted. But what said Sir BRIAN DE
    BOIS GILBERT? By the merry-maskins, but an he be not pleased,
    dub me knight Samingo! Will D'OYLY be dubbed Knight? And what
    sort of a Knight? Well, remembering a certain amusing little
    episode in the more recent history of the Savoy Theatre, why
    not a "Carpet Knight"?</p>

    <p>A MERE SUGGESTION FOR NEXT TIME.&mdash;Last Tuesday, under
    the heading of "To-day," the <i>Times</i> announced that "at
    the Society of Arts Mr. J. STARKIE GARDNER, as Cantor Lecturer,
    would discourse on 'Enamelling and Damascening,' Professor H.
    HERKOMER being in the Chair." Our excellent Bushian Professor
    was the right man in the right place, being so interested in
    theatrical matters; but, at the same time, wouldn't the lecture
    on "Damascening," or "How to Dam-a-scene," have been more
    suitably given at the Playwreckers' Club, with Mr. JERUMKY
    JERUM in the Chair?</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night, March 9</i>.&mdash;Naval
    Estimates on again. Approach delayed by action of CAMERON;
    House been Counted Out on Friday; necessary for Government to
    set up Supply again; formal Motion made by JACKSON; CAMERON
    objects; deeply distressed to think that Government should have
    fallen so low as to permit Count Out. "It's really shocking,"
    he said, "Here we are brought from our peaceful homes to London
    at this inclement season, to do the work of the nation.
    Assembled as usual on a Friday night; important business on;
    Ministers and their friends go off to dinner; and, it being
    found there are not Forty Members present, House is Counted Out
    at half-past eight. Night absolutely lost; Sitting criminally
    chucked away."</p>

    <p>"Ah!" I said, sympathetically; "must have been very hard
    upon you, sternly attending to your duty whilst others
    gambolled in the shade. And then to be suddenly Counted Out!
    How many of you were there when the Count was made?"</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/143-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/143-2.png"
             alt="'Count' Cameron." /></a>"Count" Cameron.
    </div>

    <p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;you see, TOBY," said CAMERON, almost
    blushing; "the fact is I wasn't there myself, though that, of
    course, does not deter me from invoking censure on Ministers.
    Indeed I am not sure that the circumstance doesn't place me in
    a more favourable position. Outsiders, you know, see most of
    game. I was outside; had, in fact, comfortably gone off to
    dinner, expecting other people would stop to make House. But
    they didn't, and I feel I'm just the man to make it hot for OLD
    MORALITY and his friends, who ought to have been here."</p>

    <p>Other people didn't seem to see it in quite that light.
    Condemnatory Motion negatived by 184 Votes against 42.</p>

    <p>House thereupon took up Naval Estimates. Instantly Commodore
    HARCOURT appeared in offing; landed on Front Opposition Bench,
    diffusing unwonted smell of stale mussels and seaweed.
    Commodore looked very imposing pacing down quarter-deck towards
    Mace, with telescope under his arm, sou'wester pulled well over
    his ears, and unpolished square-toed boots rising above his
    knees. A blizzard outside; snow and wind; bitterly cold; but
    the Commodore soon made it hot all round. Fell upon JOKIM spars
    and sails, stem and starn. "Regularly claw-hammered him," as
    GEORGE HAMILTON said, drawing on naval resources for adequate
    adjective. Accused him of making a speech that would have
    become CHARLES THE FIRST. Talked about levying Ship Money;
    threatened a revolution; hinted at HAMPDEN, and, unrebuked by
    the SPEAKER, called unoffending Prince ARTHUR the "youthful
    STRAFFORD."</p>

    <p>Splendid performance, only wanting an audience. But the
    storm inside House burst as suddenly as the blizzard without.
    Nobody knew that the Commodore was close-hauled, and meant
    business. Few present to witness the perturbed scene on the
    Treasury Bench:&mdash;OLD MORALITY huddled up against GEORGIE
    HAMILTON, who was nervously tearing sheet of paper into
    measured strips; JOKIM shaking in every limb, and white to the
    lips; Prince ARTHUR most successful of the group in maintaining
    his self-possession, though evidently not liking the reference
    to STRAFFORD. The Commodore, looking in his tarpaulins
    considerably more than six foot high, stormed and raged what
    time the snow and sleet beat a wild accompaniment on the
    melancholy windows.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Commodore HARCOURT goes again on
    the rampage.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;HOWARD VINCENT rather staggered
    to-night. Favoured by fortune and the ballot, had secured first
    place for Motion on Friendly Societies. Useful thing for coming
    General Election to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"
       id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span> remembered as advocate of
       cause of Working Man. Bestowed much care on terms of
       Resolution; invited Government to encourage more general
       voluntary provision for sickness and old age. Then adroitly
       dragged in the axiom that "Sound principles of provident
       Insurance should be included in the subjects prescribed by
       the Education Code for instruction in elementary schools."
       That meant to draw OLD MORALITY; succeeded <i>à
       merveille</i>.</p>

    <p>"TOBY, dear boy," he said to me, half closing his eyes, and
    folding his arms, whilst a far-away look melted into newer
    softness his kindly countenance, "that reminds me of old days.
    Many a time have I written out in my copybook, 'Take care of
    your Neighbour's Pence, and your own Pounds will Take Care of
    Themselves.' 'Borrow an Umbrella, and put it away for a Rainy
    Day.' 'Half a Currant Bun is better than No Bread'; 'A Bird in
    a Pigeon Pie is better than three in the Bush.' Got heaps of
    copy-books filled with these and similar words of wisdom.
    HOWARD VINCENT is quite right. If there was more of this in our
    elementary schools, there would be, if I may say so, more men
    like me. You remember what Who's-This said, 'Let me write their
    copy-book headings, and I don't care who makes their laws.'
    HOWARD VINCENT is on the right tack; think we shall accept his
    Resolution."</p>

    <p>So it would have been, if that eminent strategist had
    foregone his speech. If he had laid Resolution on the table,
    and said, "There you are," Government would have accepted it,
    and he would have had a night of triumph. But he would speak.
    Spoke for an hour, and utterly ruined chances of the Resolution
    he recommended.</p>

    <p>HERBERT MAXWELL, put up from Treasury Bench to reply for
    Government, did his work admirably. After fearful <i>fiasco</i>
    with CHAPLIN last Friday, OLD MORALITY checked disposition to
    give young Ministers opportunity of distinguishing themselves.
    If MAXWELL made a mull of this, following on Friday week's
    catastrophe with CHAPLIN, it would be serious. MAXWELL won more
    than negative credit of not making mistake. He delivered
    excellent speech, showing complete mastery of subject.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;House Counted Out again.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;An Irish night at last, Quite a long
    time since we talked of the distressful country. Wouldn't guess
    that Ireland was to the fore by looking at the Irish quarter.
    Usual when Prince ARTHUR is on his feet expounding and
    defending his policy for Irish camp to be bristling with
    contradiction and contumely. To-night only five there,
    including BRER RABBIT. BRER FOX promised to come, but hasn't
    turned up. Understood to be engaged in composition of new
    Manifesto. Towards midnight Prince ARTHUR, wearied of the
    quietude, observed that he didn't believe there was a single
    Irish Member present. Whereupon NOLAN, waking from sleep, under
    shadow of Gallery, indignantly shouted out, "What?" TANNER,
    just come in, roared, "Oh!" "Ah!" said Prince ARTHUR, and the
    conversation terminated.</p>

             McNeill "prating."
    </div>

    <p>Explanation of singular abstention is, that business under
    discussion is Vote on account of Relief of Distress in Ireland.
    Prince ARTHUR asks for £55,000 for that purpose; wouldn't do
    for Irish Members to obey their first instinct, and oppose Vote
    moved by Chief Secretary. If they were there, they might be
    expected to say, "Thank you;" so they stay away, one or two
    just looking in to contradict T.W. RUSSELL&mdash;"Roaring"
    RUSSELL, SARK calls him&mdash;when he gave an account of what
    he saw during a recent visit to Ireland.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Relief voted for Irish
    Distress.</p>

    <p><i>Friday Night</i>.&mdash;Lo! a strange thing happened.
    Fell asleep just now, amid deadly dulness, depth of which no
    one outside House can comprehend. Woke up, hearing familiar
    voice. 'Twas the voice of Prince ARTHUR, I heard him complain;
    something about Ground-rents in London. Not, quite his subject;
    voice, too, didn't seem to come from Treasury Bench. But no
    mistaking it; same tone; same inflection. Now I come to think
    of it, more like way he used to talk before he came to govern
    Ireland. Opened eyes; looked down; behold! it was brother
    GERALD, opposing STUART's Motion on Land Tax. Very odd; think
    I'll go to sleep again.</p>

            cantharides?</p>

            <p>We perchance may fall before it, waging an unequal
            strife,</p>

            <p>But it's any odds the patient will be blistered out
            of life.</p>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Therefore, O my friends, take heart, and these
            indignities endure,</p>

            <p>Although every week brings news of an indubitable
            cure;</p>

            <p>We have lived and flourished freely ever since the
            world began,</p>

            <p>And our lineage is as ancient surely as is that of
            man;</p>

            <p>While I'll venture the prediction, as a wind-up to
            my song,</p>

    <h4>(<i>A Fragment from a History of the Future.</i>)</h4>

    <p>And so it happened that the King was taken and imprisoned,
    no one knew whither. His followers, saving one, treated the
    matter very calmly. The exception, who was supposed to be
    wanting in his wits (he played on the barrel-organ), determined
    to do his best to rescue his Royal Master; and an idea occurred
    to him. He had noticed that when he performed on his musical
    instrument those who, perforce, were obliged to listen to him
    acted strangely. Some of his audiences had frowned, others had
    shaken their fists at him, and all had gone quickly away. Only
    once had a loiterer stayed behind, smiling a sweet smile, as if
    he were enjoying the music. To his regret, BLONDEL subsequently
    ascertained that the apparently charmed listener was stone
    deaf. So he argued that if his music had so great an effect
    upon the population of his native village it would work marvels
    in the wide world without. And thus, with a heart full of hope
    and courage, he started on his travels.</p>

    <p>He wandered, turning the handle of his organ, for many a
    weary mile. He passed through towns, hamlets, and cities; the
    people put their heads out of their windows, and urged him
    imperiously to be gone; and as he hurried away he gazed at
    their faces, hoping to have seen the King, his Master, but
    without avail. He felt, that were His Majesty to hear his
    music, there would be a farther supply of language savouring
    rather of the dicing-house than the cathedral. But, alas! his
    search was in vain. At length, he reached London, and found it
    as silent as the grave! There were no German bands, no Niggers,
    not even a hurdy-gurdy! Greatly surprised, BLONDEL asked a
    policeman the meaning of this strange, this unlooked-for
    quietude!</p>

    <p>"Strike up that organ of yours," said the constable,
    surlily, "and I will soon show you!"</p>

    <p>BLONDEL turned his handle, and was immediately arrested.</p>

    <p>"What for?" echoed the policeman; "why, for infringing the
    provisions of the Jacobi Street Music Prohibition Act!"</p>

    <p>And with this brief explanation BLONDEL was carried off to
    prison!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
